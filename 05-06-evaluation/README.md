# Comparison of Low-power DNS Transports & Evaluation of Caching for DoC
This directory contains the device applications, scripts, plots, and data aggregates used for
Section 5 _Comparison of Low-power DNS Transports_ and Section 6 _Evaluation of Caching for DoC_ of
the paper.



## Overview

### Experiment types

There are three main experiment types that can be conducted and evaluated with the artifacts in this
directory. Note that this does not include the build and packet size plots.


##### `baseline`

![The `baseline` setup.](figs/setup-baseline.svg)

A simple set-up with a single [DoC client] separated by a single hop to the border router. We used
this experiment types primarily to validate our implementation.

##### `comp`

![The `comp` setup.](figs/setup-comp.svg)

The experiment type we used for our evaluation in Section 5 _Comparison of Low-power Transports_,
i.e., at least 2 [DoC client] that query 50 records from a DoC server via a [forwarder/forward
proxy] and [border router] without any caching. There are 4 subtypes of this experiment type:

- `comp`: The base setup from our paper with 2 DoC clients. This is the subtype presented in the
  paper and depicted in the figure above.
- `comp_8`: A setup with 6 DoC clients (to a total of 8 nodes with forwarder/proxy and border
  router).
- `comp_24`: A setup with 22 DoC clients (to a total of 24 nodes with forwarder/proxy and border
  router).

##### `max_age`

![The `max_age` setup.](figs/setup-max_age.svg)

The experiment type we used for our evaluation in Section 6 _Evaluation of Caching for DoC_, i.e.,
at least 2 [DoC client] that query 50 records for 8 distinct names from a DoC server via a
[forwarder/forward proxy] and [border router] with different caching scenarios. There are 4 subtypes
of this experiment type:

- `max_age`: The base setup from our paper with 2 DoC clients. This is the subtype presented in the
  paper and depicted in the figure above.
- `max_age_8`: A setup with 6 DoC clients (to a total of 8 nodes with forwarder/proxy and border
   router).
- `max_age_24`: A setup with 22 DoC clients (to a total of 24 nodes with forwarder/proxy and
   border router).

### [`./RIOT`](./RIOT)
A [Git submodule] import of [RIOT 2022.07] with the necessary Pull Requests and patches applied on
top. Namely, this includes the patches in [`./riot-patches`](./riot-patches) and the following Pull
Requests:

- [#16861](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/16861)
- [#18329](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18329)
- [#18381](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18381)
- [#18386](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18386)
- [#18441](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18441)
- [#18443](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18443)
- [#18471](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18471)

### [`./riot-patches`](./riot-patches)
[Git patches] to RIOT required for the experiments that did not result in an upstream Pull Request.

### [`cherry-pick-prs.sh`](./cherry-pick-prs.sh)
A script that can be used to reproduce the state of [`./RIOT`](./RIOT). It fetches [RIOT 2022.07]
from the main RIOT GitHub repo, resets the submodule to that release and then [cherry-picks][git
cherry-pick] the Pull Request first and then [applies][git am] the patches from
[`./riot-patches`](./riot-patches) to it.

### [`./liboscore`](./liboscore)
A [Git submodule] import of [libOSCORE].

### [`./quant`](./quant)
A [Git submodule] import of the [Quant] QUIC network stack.

### [`./quant-patches`](./quant-patches)
[Git patches] to [Quant] to make its `riot/` application compilable for RIOT 2022.07.

### [`./apps`](./apps)
Contains the dedicated RIOT applications used for our experiments:

- [`./apps/requester`](./apps/requester) is the DNS client application used for all our experiments.
- [`./apps/proxy`](./apps/proxy) is the opaque forwarder and forward proxy application used for the
  [`comp` and `max_age` experiments][experiment types]

We also used the [border router example][border router] from the [`./RIOT`](./RIOT) submodule as the
border router.

### [`./scripts`](./scripts)
Contains the scripts to conduct and evaluate the experiments:

- [`./scripts/exp_ctrl`](./scripts/exp_ctrl) contains scripts for conducting the experiments.
- [`./scripts/plots`](./scripts/plots) contains scripts to parse the output of the `exp_ctrl`
  scripts and generate plots from them.

### [`./results`](./results)
Contains the outputs of the scripts in [`./scripts`](./scripts). Results not taken into account for
our paper are listed in subdirectories `<discard ISO date>-<reason for discard>`. You can use these
log files to generate our plots, even if you do not run the experiments yourself.

In addition to the results there is an [AWK] script [`./results/check.awk`] that can check the
output logs generated by the RIOT applications for correctness. Due to syncing issues between the
`stdio` of RIOT and FIT IoT-LAB characters might get lost in rare cases, skewing the evaluation.
This script used to spot these errors, but also unusual timeouts due to crashed or resource-drained
nodes.

All results are published under a [CC-BY 4.0](./results/LICENSE) license.
