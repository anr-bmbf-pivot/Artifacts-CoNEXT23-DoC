**All scripts can be run without running the experiments first.** In this case, our experiment
results provided in [`results/`](../../results) will be used.

## Requirements
You can skip the steps in this section if you are in the pre-configured vagrant VM.

The scripts were all tested on Ubuntu 22.04. While the scripts should be possible to run in other
operating systems (especially the Python scripts), we do not guarantee successful execution.
To run the commands described below, first run, e.g., `apt` on Ubuntu 22.04 to install dependencies:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl python3-pip python3-virtualenv
```

All commands in these instructions are assumed to be run from the
[`05-06-evaluation/scripts/plots`](.) directory.

All required python libraries are listed in [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt). They can be
installed using [pip] with the commands below.
We recommend installing them to a [Virtualenv] as shown, but it is not strictly necessary.

```sh
virtualenv env
. env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

[TShark] is required for the PCAP parsing.

As the plots are rendered with LaTeX rendering, a LaTeX installation compatible with `matplotlib` is
required. For more information, please read [the `matplotlib` documentation][matplotlib usetex].

The `collect_build_sizes.py` and `collect_esp32_build_sizes.py` scripts require the respective
toolchains for the boards to be installed and `PATH` needs to contain their respective `bin`
directories:

- `collect_build_sizes.py`: [Arm GNU Toolchain] (tested with version 10.3-2021.07)
  ```sh
  sudo mkdir -p /opt
  sudo curl -sL -o /opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi.tar.bz2 \
      https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/10.3-2021.07/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.07-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2
  echo "b56ae639d9183c340f065ae114a30202 /opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi.tar.bz2" | md5sum -c && \
      sudo tar -C /opt -jxf /opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi.tar.bz2
  export PATH="${PATH}:/opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.07/bin"
  ```
- `collect_esp32_build_sizes.py`: [Espressif Crosstool NG] (tested with version esp-2021r2-patch3)
  ```sh
  sudo mkdir -p /opt
  sudo curl -sL -o /opt/gcc-xtensa-esp32-elf.tar.gz \
      https://github.com/espressif/crosstool-NG/releases/download/esp-2021r2-patch3/xtensa-esp32-elf-gcc8_4_0-esp-2021r2-patch3-linux-amd64.tar.gz
  echo "5c4386fcbbfa3f483555827c414396f1 /opt/gcc-xtensa-esp32-elf.tar.gz" | md5sum -c &&
      sudo tar -C /opt -zxf /opt/gcc-xtensa-esp32-elf.tar.gz &&
  export PATH="${PATH}:/opt/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin"
  . env/bin/activate
  pip install pyserial
  ```
   + In addition, to build Quant, you will need, e.g., with `apt` on Ubuntu 22.04:
     ```sh
     sudo update
     sudo apt install libssl-dev libhttp-parser-dev libbsd-dev pkgconf g++
     export WERROR=0
     export RIOTBASE="$(readlink -f '../../RIOT')"
     export CFLAGS="-DPTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER=MUTEX_INIT"
     ```

## Testing

The python scripts are tested for python versions 3.7 to 3.11 using [tox]. To test and lint the
code, run the following in this directory ([`05-06-evaluation/scripts/plots`](./)). If the python
version under test is installed, the tests for it will be executed.

```sh
tox
```

## Usage and results

For all scripts the environment variable `DATA_PATH` can be used to change their in- and output
path. The default is [`05-06-evaluation/results/`](./../../results).

Most of the `./plot_*.py` scripts can be provided a `mplstyle` style sheet using the `-s` argument.
See [matplotlib documentation][mplstyle] for more information.

The `-h` flag can be used on all python scripts to gain more insights on the arguments that can be
provided, e.g.

```
./plot_pkt_sizes.py -h
```

### `parse_*_results.py`

The scripts `parse_baseline_results.py`, `parse_comp_results.py`, and `parse_max_age_results.py` can
be used to parse the log files generated by the dispatch scripts in
[`05-06-evaluation/scripts/exp_ctrl`](./../exp_ctrl) into CSV files usable for the plotting
`plot_*.py` scripts. They take the log files from `DATA_PATH` and generate for each log `<name>.log`
a `<name>.times.csv` and a `<name>.stats.csv` from the application output in `DATA_PATH`.

`<name>.times.csv` contains various event timings in relation to a query sent. Depending on the
experiment type, it contains up to 10 columns:

- `transport` notes the DNS transport used.
- `node` notes the FIT IoT-Lab node the query was sent from.
- `id` notes the ID of the DNS query (i.e. the first five characters of the name).
- `query_time` notes the time as a UNIX timestamp the query was sent.
- `response_time` notes the time as a UNIX timestamp the response to the query was received. If
  there was no response, the column is empty.
- `transmission_ids` notes the various IDs the DNS transport uses as a Python list for the query and
  its response.
- `transmissions` notes the times as a Python list of UNIX timestamps the DNS transport sent a
  message containing the query.
- `dns_cache_hits` notes the times as a Python list of UNIX timestamps a DNS cache hit happened for
  the DNS query. If there was no cache hit, the column is empty.
- `cache_hits` notes the times as a Python list of UNIX timestamps when a CoAP cache hit happened at
  the CoAP forward proxy for the DNS query or if a CoAP cache entry was re-validated due to the DNS
  query. If there was no cache hit and no cache validation happened, the column is empty.
- `client_cache_hits` notes the times as a Python list of UNIX timestamps when a CoAP cache hit
  happened at the DoC client for the DNS query or if a CoAP cache entry was re-validated due to the
  DNS query. If there was no cache hit and no cache validation happened, the column is empty.

An example of such a CSV file can be found in
[`doc-eval-proxy-ieee802154-udp-proxied0-None-None-50x5.0-A-297517-1645826017.times.csv`](../../results/doc-eval-proxy-ieee802154-udp-proxied0-None-None-50x5.0-A-297517-1645826017.times.csv)
and the other `*.times.csv` files which were generated from our experiment logs.

`<name>.stats.csv` contains link layer statistics collected by the application on the node after an
experiment run. Those were not used in the paper for any plots in the end (we used externally
sniffed PCAP dumps to analyze the link utilization), but they were kept for completeness. They
contain 6 columns:

- `node` notes the FIT IoT-Lab node the stats were taken from.
- `l2_sent` notes the number of link-layer packets sent from `node` during the experiment run.
- `l2_received` notes the number of link-layer packets received at `node` during the experiment run.
- `l2_success` notes the number of successfully transmitted link-layer packets from `node` during
  the experiment run.
- `l2_multicast` notes the number of multicast or broadcast link-layer packets from `node` during
  the experiment run.
- `l2_error` notes the number of unsuccessfully transmitted link-layer packets from `node` during
  the experiment run.

An example of such a CSV file can be found in
[`doc-eval-proxy-ieee802154-udp-proxied0-None-None-50x5.0-A-297517-1645826017.stats.csv`](../../results/doc-eval-proxy-ieee802154-udp-proxied0-None-None-50x5.0-A-297517-1645826017.stats.csv)
and the other `*.stats.csv` files which were generated from our experiment logs.

You can change the verbosity of the output of the script using the `-v <log level>` argument. See
e.g.

```sh
./parse_baseline_results.py -h
```

for more information.

If you run these scripts without doing any experiments prior, you will regenerate the CSV files from
our experiment logs.

### [`parse_max_age_link_util.py`](./parse_max_age_link_util.py)

This script uses [TShark] to generate a
[`doc-eval-max_age-link_utilization.csv`](../../results/doc-eval-max_age-link_utilization.csv) in
`DATA_PATH` from all PCAP files in `DATA_PATH` collected during the [`max_age` experiments].

It requires the sink and each link used during the experiment as a pair-wise list of nodes as
arguments, as this information can not be found in the PCAP file.
E.g.

```sh
./parse_max_age_link_util.py 209 209,205 205,202 205,290
```

For more information use

```sh
./parse_max_age_link_util.py -h
```

The output CSV file contains the following columns:

- `exp_timestamp` notes the time as a UNIX timestamp when the experiment was started.
- `max_age_config` notes the caching approach used for the experiment, `dohlike` for _DoH-like_ and
  `eolttls` for `EOL TTLs`.
- `method` notes the CoAP method used during the experiment.
- `dns_cache` notes if a DNS cache was used for the experiment. 0 means no DNS cache was used, 1
  means that the DoC clients used a DNS cache.
- `client_coap_cache` notes if a CoAP cache was used at the DoC clients for the experiment. 0 means
  no CoAP cache was used, 1 means that the DoC clients used a CoAP cache.
- `proxied` notes that a caching CoAP forward proxy was used for the experiments. 0 means the
  intermediate node acted as an opaque IPv6 forwarder, 1 means it acted as a caching CoAP forward
  proxy.
- `node` notes the number in the name of the M3 node in the FIT IoT LAB for which the link
  utilization is gathered in this row.
- `distance` notes the distance of node identified by `node` to the border router in hops.
- `queries_bytes` notes the number of bytes used on the link layer by queries for the node
  identified by `node`.
- `queries_packets` notes the number of packets used on the link layer by queries for the node
  identified by `node`.
- `queries_frags` notes the number of 6LoWPAN fragments used on the link layer by queries for the
  node identified by `node`.
- `responses_bytes` notes the number of bytes used on the link layer by responses to the node
  identified by `node`.
- `responses_packets` notes the number of packets used on the link layer by responses to the node
  identified by `node`.
- `responses_frags` notes the number of 6LoWPAN fragments used on the link layer by responses to the
  node identified by `node`.

### [`collect_build_sizes.py`](./collect_build_sizes.py)

This script uses `make cosy` of RIOT to generate a  `doc-eval-build-sizes-<transport>.json` in
`DATA_PATH` for each DNS transport (`coap` and `coaps` with and without GET method support).
It takes the output of the `make cosy` command for the [DoC client application][DoC client] with
the `COSY_NO_WEBSERVER=1` for the different compile-time configurations for `obj`, `size`, `sym`,
and `type` symbols and transforms it into parsable JSON. An example output can be seen in
[`doc-eval-build-sizes-udp.json`](./../../results/doc-eval-build-sizes-udp.json).

### [`collect_esp32_build_sizes.py`](./collect_esp32_build_sizes.py)

This script uses `nm` to generate a  `doc-eval-esp32-build-sizes-<app_name><transport>.csv` in
`DATA_PATH` for the [DoC client application][DoC client] and the
[`./riot` application of Quant][Quant] each DNS transport. Compared to `collect_build_sizes.py`,
`nm` is used instead of `make cosy`, since the latter does not support the ESP32 architecture at the
point of this writing. The resulting CSV contains a line for each relevant symbol, with columns
`text`, `data`, `bss`, `filename`, and `sym`. An example output can be seen in
[`doc-eval-esp32-build-sizes-quant.csv`](./../../results/doc-eval-esp32-build-sizes-quant.csv).

### [`plot_pkt_sizes.py`](./plot_pkt_sizes.py)

This script plots the link layer packet sizes of the different message types seen in our
[`comp` experiments] as depicted in Figure 6 in our paper and stores the plots as SVG and PDF files
in `DATAPATH`. It excludes, however, CoAP packets that were transferred block-wise and those that
used the GET and POST method. We have [`plot_pkt_sizes_coap.py`](#plot_pkt_sizes_coappy) for that.

An example of the output can be seen below:

### [`plot_pkt_sizes_hypo.py`](./plot_pkt_sizes_hypo.py)

This script plots the link layer packet sizes of the different message types similar
to Figure 6 in our paper for different hypothetical packet headers in the lower layers and based
on the key statistical values for name lengths in DNS from Section 3 of our paper and stores the
plots as SVG and PDF files in `DATAPATH`.
It assumes different header formats, e.g., with IEEE 802.15.4 long address or short addresses,
with and without IEEE 802.15.4 security headers, different CoAP header compositions, different URI
paths, and plots them for the minimum, median, mean, and maximum name lengths observed in Section 3
of our paper.

### [`plot_pkt_sizes_slides.py`](./plot_pkt_sizes_slides.py)
This script plots the link layer packet sizes of the different message types seen
in our [`comp` experiments] similar to Figure 6 in our paper and stores the plots as SVG and PDF
files in `DATAPATH`. In contrast to [`plot_pkt_sizes.py`](#plot_pkt_sizespy), it splits up for slide
decks that compare the packet sizes directly to the resolution time CDFs generated with
[`plot_comp_cdf.py`](#plot_comp_cdfpy). It also does not show the different layers of the packet.

### [`plot_comp_trans.py`](./plot_comp_trans.py)
This script plots a transmission graph with the DNS query timestamp to event time offset to DNS
query, similar to Figure 11 in our paper for the [`comp` experiments] and stores the plots as SVG
and PDF files in `DATAPATH`.

An example of the output can be seen below:

   CoAP FETCH events of message (re-)transmissions at the client compared to the time of the initial
   DNS AAAA record query for over an opaque forwarder (left) and having a caching forward proxy
   (right). Retransmissions follow an exponential back-off and scatter within specific (gray) areas.
   Size and opacity of each marker represent the multiplicity of events in the same area. Right
   to each sub-plot, the density of the events is plotted as a rotated CDF (x- and y-axis swapped).

### [`plot_max_age_link_util.py`](./plot_max_age_link_util.py)
This script plots a link utilization plot with distance to sink to bytes and L2 frames,
respectively as depicted in Figure 10 in our paper for [`max_age` experiments] and stores the plots
as SVG and PDF files in `DATAPATH`.

Examples of the output can be seen below:

### [`plot_done.py`](./plot_done.py)
This script plots a matrix of all possible and required experiment run configurations and how many
of each are still missing for the full set of 10 runs and stores the plots as SVG and PDF files in
`DATAPATH`. It helps with keeping an overview over how many runs of each experiment scenario are
still missing.

### [`plot_all.sh`](./plot_all.sh)

Runs all plotting scripts for plots used in the paper. It expects no arguments:

```sh
./plot_all.sh
```

Namely, the scripts run are in that order:

- [`plot_comp_cdf.py`](./plot_comp_cdf.py) (Figure 7),
- [`plot_comp_cdf_blockwise.py`](./plot_comp_cdf_blockwise.py) (Figure 15),
- [`plot_pkt_sizes.py`](./plot_pkt_sizes.py) (Figure 6),
- [`plot_pkt_sizes_coap.py`](./plot_pkt_sizes_coap.py) (Figure 13),
- [`plot_pkt_sizes_quic.py`](./plot_pkt_sizes_quic.py) (Figure 9),
- [`plot_build_sizes.py`](./plot_build_sizes.py) (Figure 5),
- [`plot_esp32_build_sizes.py`](./plot_esp32_build_sizes.py) (Figure 8),
- [`plot_max_age_trans.py`](./plot_max_age_trans.py) (Figure 11), and
- [`plot_max_age_link_util.py`](./plot_max_age_link_util.py) (Figure 10).

Note, that this does not call the respective `parse_*_results.py` and `parse_max_age_link_util.py`
scripts, nor are `collect_build_sizes.py` or `collect_esp32_build_sizes.py` called. Please call
them, if need be for each required [experiment type][experiment types], before running this script.
The required experiment types are [`comp`][`comp` experiments] and
[`max_age`][`max_age` experiments].
